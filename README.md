Projext Name: PyCity Schools Analysis

#Description

In order to help the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities, I have to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. With the data of student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. My task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

Under the folder PyCitySchools are the script file PyCitySchool_homework.ipynb and Resources folder with school and student csv data files.


#coding: 
First, merge the student and school data to obtain a complete resource data for analysis, the folowing summaries are calculated and showed in DataFrame as school performace indicators and for comparison.
* District Summary
* School Summary
* Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
* Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
* Math Scores by Grade
* Reading Scores by Grade
* Scores by School Spending
* Scores by School Size
* Scores by School Type

#conclusion:
* schools with higher budgets did not yield better test results. By contrast, schools with higher spending 645-675 per student actually underperformed compared to schools with smaller budgets (585 per student).
* Smaller and medium sized schools dramatically out-performed large sized schools on passing math performances (93% passing vs 69%).
* Charter schools out-performed the public district schools across all metrics. More data will be needed to find out whether it's resulted by school practices or school size.
